# TSG Training Assignment (wk 3&4)

This repo is my assignment for the TSG training solo project, from weeks 3 and 4.

## Prereqs

To run the back-end, you will need **OpenJDK 25**.

## Setup (Unix)

At this time, the start script is only available for Unix systems (Linux, MacOS).

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/York-Solutions-B2E/jgc-tsg-stage2-assignment.git
cd jgc-tsg-stage2-assignment
./start-back.sh
```

Then, open a new terminal/shell in the cloned repo's directory, and run the following:

```Bash
./start-front.sh
```

Both of these scripts can be safely ended with <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>.
