# Java TODO

Keeping track of todo notes and work branches here.

1. In `UserService.java`, we still need to implement claim lines.
2. In `MemberService.java`, we still need to implement enrollments.

Our primary task for the backend is data creation. `ClaimService.beginClaim()` handles the first half. Once claim lines are put in, implement and run `ClaimService.endClaim(Claim myClaim)` to find the totals.
